#  SustainIQ – AI-Powered Gamified Quiz Platform

SustainIQ is a modular, production-ready quiz platform built around the **17 UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**.  
It provides an engaging quiz experience with AI-generated explanations to promote sustainability awareness through gamification.

The platform uses a **React (Vite) frontend** and an **Express.js backend**, with Grok AI integration for educational explanations.

##  Features

###  Quiz Flow
- Start Quiz → Backend generates **10 random SDG-based questions**
- Navigate questions with progress tracking
- Mandatory answer selection before submission
- Score calculation with percentage result
- SDG badge shown if score ≥ 40%
- Review mode with:
  - Correct vs. incorrect answers
  - AI-generated explanations
  - Visual overlays (green/red)

###  Dynamic Question Generation
- Questions generated from SDG dataset (not hardcoded)
- 10 unique questions per session
- Each question belongs to a different SDG
- 4 options per question (1 correct + 3 distractors)

---

###  AI Explanations
- Grok API generates educational explanations
- Provider-agnostic service abstraction
- Safe fallback explanations if API key not available

---

###  Security
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Backend validation before answer processing
- No secrets exposed to frontend

##  Architecture

### Clean Separation of Concerns
- **Frontend:** UI rendering, navigation, state, API client
- **Backend:** Quiz generation, scoring, validation, AI explanations
- **API:** REST JSON endpoints
- **Services:** AI abstraction layer (provider swappable)
- **Models:** Shared quiz data structures
